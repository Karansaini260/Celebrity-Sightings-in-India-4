In this project, learners perform face detection and recognition tasks by using a video of an interview with Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom. They use a state-of-the-art pre-trained Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) model together with Inception-ResNet model to perform face recognition. The goal is to use selected video frames of Mary Kom and her interviewer and create a face embedding for each of them. This allows learners to detect their faces on new images. Learners conclude the project by wrapping their code into a Flask app that allows a user to upload an image and perform face recognition.
